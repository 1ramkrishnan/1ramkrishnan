Ever since i got my first computer when i was a kid, software coding has been my passion. I still remember sitting in front of my computer making it print "hello World" in different programing language. My passion carried me to pursue a career in IT, did my masters in computer application and did plenty of software course. After my grad i have worked for few finance Tech companies, i am into fintech industry for past 6+ years now, learnt lot of things. Apart from my full time corporate jobs i also do few freelance projects in my weekends,if you want me to contribute in your project/business do contact me. There certainly yet more to learn and explore new tech in coming days.
